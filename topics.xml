	<text>Philadelphia, Jan.21-Modern jazz music and dancing are making the Indians wild again. The roll of the snare drum and the wail of the saxophone, combined with the "toddle" and the "shimmy" stir atavistic memories of the tom-tom and the shriek of the victim at the stake.</text>

	<text>Seemingly the pubic is divided in its opinion on this big question. Some say the younger generation is to blame. Jazz dancing and jazz music are, to repeat their own words just exactly what one might expect when the youth of land gads about in sporty automobiles, simulates contempt for Mrs.Grundy's ideas and shows a determination to do everything in a fast and snappy way.
  Others maintain that jazz is a natural reaction to Victorian customs.</text>

The fossil forests of the YellowstoneNatlon.il
park cover an extensive area in the northern por
tion of the park, being especially abundant along
the west side of Lamar river for about 20 miles
above its junction with the Yellowstone. One
traversing the valley of the Lamar river may see
at many places numerous upright fossil trunks in
the faces of nearly vertical walls. These trunks
are not all at a particular level hut occur at Irreg
ular heights; in fact a section cut down through
these 2,000 feet of beds would disclose a succes
sion of fossil forests. That is to say, after the
first forest grew and was entombed, there was a
time without volcanic outburst a period long
enougli to permit a second forest to grow above
the first. Tliis In turn was covered by volcanic
material and preserved, to.be followed again by a
period of quiet, and these more or less regular al

        <text>“The truth of his discovery now is
given to the world in Yellowstone Na
tional Park. His story about the gey
seys proved real. Jim Bridger discov
ered Yellowstone National. Park and
didn’t know it. He was laughed to
scorn by his playmates of the plains.”
In 1869 C. W. Cook and David Fol
som, hearing the persistent stories
of Bridger, decided to investigate.
They rode out to the land of the
geysers and discovered what now is
Yellowston National Park. They were
followed by the Washburn expedition,
members of which conceived the idea
of a national park. Their idea was
capitalized, and near Madison Junc
tion today you will find a marker dat
ed September 19, 1870, which sets
forth the national park idea. In the
party that conceived the idea for the
birth of Yellowstone Park were Gen
eral H. D. Washburn, Lieutenant G. C.
Doane and several civilians.
Were Jim Bridger alive today he
might slap his riding chaps and
chortle at his fellows of the corral:
“I told you so!” he might exult.
“You didn’t believe me. You called
me the biggest liar west of the Mis
souri. Come on out and look it over,
you bunch of cowstall bums!”
Those cowboys who lived after
Bridger were willing to admit the
righteousness of his story. They were
the first to see Yellowstone after word
was sent out that the great park was
in the making. The playground of
“God’s Country,” found by Jim Briger,
their pal, was to become the most
famous spot of scenic beauty on the
face of this man’s great, green, gor
geous earth.</text>

        <text>Diagram of Stretch No. 4
all! just picture Jourself as being
under a big cherry tree and that yo u
are stretching on tip toes to get
two handfuls of cherries.
Keep up there without straining
as long as possible. It won’t be
long at first because your muscles,
unused to this exercise, will ache
at the outset and you will be glad
to come down quickly to a flat-foot
position on the floor. Try to come
down slowly and deliberately as you
continue. Breathe deeply. When
you get up to the top of the stretch
try to bold the position and gradu
ally inhale, easily, the idea being
not to breathe according to count,
but deeply, easily and naturally.
Come down slowly, but keep the
hands up above your head, with the
first finger of each hand just touch
ing tips. That will force you to
keep at balance, and besides, it
aids the stretch.</text>
